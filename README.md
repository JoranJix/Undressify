### Intro

This is the successor to "ForceUndress".
After a very unfortunate event, the system had to be rewritten from scratch. As a result, the creator has changed.
Also the code is a completely new one and is much leaner.
Some functions were deliberately left out and other better ones were added.
For example, a database is no longer necessary, as each system uses its own database in SL. 
Friends on your friends list can now undress you without an extra entry.
What is still missing are sounds. 
All old data, objects and scripts are lost forever. So a new start had to be made.

### Bug Reporting

If you discover a bug or a problem, pleas open an issue here on GitHub!

### Key Features:
- People on your SL friendlist can undress you
- Easy to configure access list
- Its possible to let anyone undress you
- Undress animations

### INSTRUCTIONS


## How to create the folders

!!NEVER KEEP THE HUD WITHIN YOUR ~undressify FOLDER!! 
It would get detached on avatar change.
I dont take any responsibilities if the hud fails working with other RLV tools.
You have to create a basic folder structure which is explained below.
Following Folder Structure is needed to run OpenUndress

Look at the examples to see how your folders need to look like!

#RLV\~undressify\av\<youravatarname>

![Avatar](https://github.com/JoranJix/Undressify/assets/4482238/225f0f78-8195-4bb7-81c3-0dc1745f25ae)
    
Put your naked avatar into this folder. 
You can have multiple folders. Load an avatar from the >Avatar< button!

#RLV\~undressify\of\<youroutfitname>

![outfits (2)](https://github.com/JoranJix/Undressify/assets/4482238/74024574-533a-4f31-9574-f19164618187)
    
Put your ouftfit into this folder. 
You can have multiple folders. 
Load an Outfit from the >Outfits< button! 
The button >Clothing< will appear.
Click it and check how your clothing will be undressed. 
#RLV\~undressify\addon\<category>\<item>

![Addons](https://github.com/JoranJix/Undressify/assets/4482238/bc536f69-9b79-4f2c-ade0-532bd3b945eb)

Holds stuff you dont want in your outfits like AOs or Dancehuds.. etcetera

You can now click your belly or lower back to open the menu and load your avatar, outfit etcetera...

## Tips and tricks

If you change some textures via HUD on some of your clothing,
take that piece off manually and reattach it after you changed it.
Sl tends to ignore the change when something is detached via RLV
Sounds corrospond to the folder names. So if you you have a folder named 'top_1' the sound for it is 'top'
You can place your own sounds in the object for different sounds
