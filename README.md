INSTRUCTIONS


How to create the folders
    !!NEVER KEEP THE HUD WITHIN YOUR ~undressify FOLDER!! 
    It would get detached on avatar change.
    I dont take any responsibilities if the hud fails working with other RLV tools.
    You have to create a basic folder structure which is explained below.
    Following Folder Structure is needed to run OpenUndress

    Look at the examples to see how your folders need to look like!##
    #RLV\~undressify\av\<youravatarname>
    ![Avatar](https://github.com/JoranJix/Undressify/assets/4482238/225f0f78-8195-4bb7-81c3-0dc1745f25ae)
    
    Put your naked avatar into this folder. You can have multiple folders. Load an avatar from the >Avatar< button!
    #RLV\~undressify\of\<youroutfitname>
    ![outfits (2)](https://github.com/JoranJix/Undressify/assets/4482238/74024574-533a-4f31-9574-f19164618187)
    
    Put your ouftfit into this folder. You can have multiple folders. Load an Outfit from the >Outfits< button! The button >Clothing< will appear.
    Click it and check how your clothing will be undressed. 
    #RLV\~undressify\addon\<category>\<item>
    ![Addons](https://github.com/JoranJix/Undressify/assets/4482238/bc536f69-9b79-4f2c-ade0-532bd3b945eb)
    Holds stuff you dont want in your outfits like AOs or Dancehuds.. etcetera


Tips and tricks

    If you change some textures via HUD on some of your clothing,
    take that piece off manually and reattach it after you changed it.
    Sl tends to ignore the change when something is detached via RLV
    Sounds corrospond to the folder names. So if you you have a folder named 'top_1' the sound for it is 'top'
    You can place your own sounds in the object for different sounds
